STUDY OF THE ANISOTROPIC MICROSTRUCTURE OF THE UNIAXIALLY COLD COMPACTED METAL POWDERS (GREEN PARTS)
## Background
Most theoretical works do not consider plastic deformation of metal powder particles when uniaxially cold compacted. 
Due to the deformation two phenomena can happen; structural defects of powder particles (structural activity) which is expected to influence mass transport phenomenon responsible for anisotropy of shrinkage and extension on contact regions (geometrical activity) which modifies the relationship between the neck size growth and shrinkage of particles resulting in anisotropy of dimensional change.
Moreover, dislocation density introduced by plastic deformation of the particles attributes to the inhomogeneous microstructure of the green body, inducing 
extension of interparticle contacts since plastic deformation modifies significantly the morphology of the contacts.

## Summary
  -  The measurement of length of interparticle contact regions verified the anisotropy of dimensional
change 'resulting in differet values' along both traversal and longitudinal directions.
  -  The contact number & effective contact number along transversal & longitudinal directions also
verified the anisotropy of shrinkge showing different values along the two directions and slightly
increasing on increasing green density & particle size.
  -  The values of shrinkage estimated by introducing measured contact lengths in a theoretically
developed shrinkage kinetics equation verified the anisotropy of sintering shrinkage by resulting
in different values along both directions.
  -  The effective diffusivity suitable during sintering cycle for the green part has been calculated to
account for overestimation made during shrinkage estimation & it increases on increasing density
and particle size, but more pronounced along longitudinal direction.

  -  FEM model developed for deformation of a particle during cold compaction has been verified by
introducing measured equivalent diameter of the particles, stress-strain curve data points & other
material properties. The resut showed very close with 1% deviation in ratio with the measured
values.

  -  The theoretical calculation does not predict properly the contact length due to deformation,
because the real stress-strain curve of AISI 316L was not used; the differences in yield strength &
strain hardening coefficiend modifiy the results.

  -  Neverthless, the ratio between contact lengths is very close to the measured one; hence, it will be
expected to have the real values when the true stress-strain curve of AISI 316L will be used.
