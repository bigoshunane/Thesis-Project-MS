### Background

Most theoretical works do not consider plastic deformation of metal powder particles when uniaxially cold compacted. 
Due to the deformation two phenomena can happen; structural defects of powder particles (structural activity) are expected to influence mass transport phenomenon responsible for anisotropy of shrinkage and extension on contact regions (geometrical activity) modifies the relationship between the neck size growth and shrinkage of particles resulting in anisotropy of dimensional change.
Moreover, dislocation density introduced by plastic deformation of the particles attributes to the inhomogeneous microstructure of the green body, inducing 
extension of interparticle contacts since plastic deformation modifies significantly the morphology of the contacts.

### Objective

1.  Verification of the anisotropy of dimensional change of the microstructures of uniaxially cold compacted green parts/austenitic steel powder AISI-316L

    by experimantal approach; i.e by measuring interparticles contact length of metallographic images.
    
2.  Verify sintering shrinkage equation developed in previous work considering time depending bulk diffusion coefficient, Deff.

3.  Verify FEM Model developed for prediction of particles deformation during cold compation along traversal and longitudinal directions.
