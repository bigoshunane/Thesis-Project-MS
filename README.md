STUDY OF THE ANISOTROPIC MICROSTRUCTURE OF THE UNIAXIALLY COLD COMPACTED METAL POWDERS (GREEN PARTS)
## Background
Most theoretical works do not consider plastic deformation of metal powder particles when uniaxially cold compacted. 
Due to the deformation two phenomena can happen; structural defects of powder particles (structural activity) which is expected to influence mass transport phenomenon responsible for anisotropy of shrinkage and extension on contact regions (geometrical activity) which modifies the relationship between the neck size growth and shrinkage of particles resulting in anisotropy of dimensional change.
Moreover, dislocation density introduced by plastic deformation of the particles attributes to the inhomogeneous microstructure of the green body, inducing 
extension of interparticle contacts since plastic deformation modifies significantly the morphology of the contacts.

## Objective (What?)
-  Verification of the anisotropy of dimensional change of the microstructures of uniaxially cold compacted green parts/austenitic steel powder AISI-316L; by experimantal approach; i.e by measuring interparticles contact length of metallographic images.
    
-  Verify sintering shrinkage equation developed in previous work considering time depending bulk diffusion coefficient (Deff).

-  Verify FEM Model developed for prediction of particles deformation during cold compaction along traversal and longitudinal directions by measuring particles mean diameters and introducing computed equivalent diameter into the FEM model.

## Approach (How?
-  EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
   -  Metal powder cold compaction and Metallographic analsis:
      -  A. Measuring interparticles contact length.
      -  B. Measuring particles mean diameter and equivalent diameter is computed.

-  Contact length measurement
